# moodsound
I made this pure React.js project basically to:
- Make some use of it.
- Adjust it to fit my exquisite needs.
- Have some visual fun and a bit surprise with a song choice.
- Listen to music.


## Important note!
At the moment this project is **not** suitable for mobiles.


## How to start
You can just simply go to [the project's website](https://malastrasza.github.io/Moodsound_react.js/) 

or

you can clone this repo, [install npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) and for the project to start, type in your console:
```
npm start
```

## How to use
It's a one-page site, so after each answer you are shown next question with more answers. After few questions you are given a song that instantly plays on the site. Each song has mostly 3 combinations of answers for it to play, hence you can have different outputs with each attempt. To start again, simply refresh the page.


## Technologies used
- React.js
- react-youtube
- Firebase


## Project status
#### What more shall I add?
- A 'previous page' button.
- More randomnes among questions.
- Color of the final page background depending on album artwork color (since ColorAPI wasn't working the way I wanted, I will go for a js solution).
- More songs.
- Slight visual changes to background and buttons.
- Better structure of a code, since it went a bit spaghetti.
